    <!-- Debouncing and throttling is mainly used to limit the rate of the function calls 
    . The function calls may be anything it might be fetching the api from the server
    or logging anything on a logger etc 
    -->

    <!-- Debouncing : make an api call if the diffrence between two keystroke events is more than a given time interval
         throttling : make a api call after given interval of time and ignore the keystroke events occurs
         in between   
    -->

    <!--   When debouncing more sense : on all ecommrece website when user search for the items  
           when throttling makes more sense : suppose we want to keep a track of when the someone
           resizing the browser or how frequently someone resizing the browser
