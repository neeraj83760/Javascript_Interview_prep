    <!-- Its a technique of handling event in the webpage in a better way  -->
    <!-- Event Delegation is based on Event bubbling -->

    <!-- It says attaching the EventHandler individually or on the child elements
         You should attach the eventHandlers directly to the parent element 
         It will reduce the headover of using too many eventHandlers 
         also it will improve the performance of the webapage as well 
    -->

    <!-- Event delegation saves the memeory because less usage of eventhandlers -->

    <!-- Second benefit of event delegation is writing less code  -->


    <!-- Limitations of Event Listeners  -->
    <!-- 
    
        All the events don't bubbled up like : blur, focus, resizing of the window 

        You can also check the same in the Event Listener by e.bubbles and store
        it in the variable
